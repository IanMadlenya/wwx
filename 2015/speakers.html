					<h2>What is Haxe?</h2>
					<p>Of course you might already know what Haxe is. But it’s actually many different things. A language, a compiler, a set of tools. How do we define Haxe today and how will it evolve in the future? Nicolas will be there to answer these questions and present Haxe Foundation goals.</p>

					<h2>Real Multiplatform Games : Why Haxe?</h2>
					<p>An overview of where Haxe fits into the current landscape of cross-platform game technologies.
Reasons why Haxe is currently the only truly multiplatform game solution viable for building high-performance games across all platforms.  Predictions as to which technologies will be valuable in the future.  Spoiler Alert!  Haxe wins.</p>

					<h2>Storytelling with data + Haxe/Neko</h2>
					<p>The main goal of data visualization is its ability to communicate information clearly and effectively.
Despite the “big data” effort, a lot of interesting resource is not available through an API, but distributed as files (json, xml, csv, excel…). What can you do when a file exceed 10 GigaBytes or when you have to deal with complex spreadsheets. How can you quickly dig into your content and make sure that it contains relevant information?
Because of it’s amazing speed on reading, processing and writing text based files, Haxe/Neko is of great assistance to do this preliminary job. In my session, I will show you how I used Haxe/Neko to extract relevant data and prepare essential resources for my data­visualizations.</p>

					<h2>Web Apps in Haxe (an idea whose time has come)</h2>
					<p>If you’ve spent any time with Haxe, you know that it’s powerful, especially in its native environment: gaming. But what about using Haxe for websites and web apps? Is it production ready? What does a full stack Haxe web app look like? What are the advantages with using Haxe over Rails or Django? What are the challenges?

In this talk we’ll look at a recent web app we’ve made, share our experience, the lessons we’ve learned and some of the tools and libraries available to you when writing web apps. And then, to prove that Haxe is ready for the prime-time in developing full scale web apps, we’ll quickly create a demo app so that you can see how it all fits together.</p>

					<h2>Conquering uniform cross-platform text rendering</h2>
					<p>Our product at Prezi is a presentation tool that needs to show presentations in exactly the same way on a growing number of platforms and devices. Prezi is all about zooming, so even the slightest differences are enlarged. Of the parts that make up a presentation, text is the hardest to get right: each platform has it’s slightly different way of displaying text. So we decided to roll our own solution, with Haxe at its core. We had to add some other things, like JavaScript and C++ to the mix as well. Come and see how all this fit together in the Prezi text rendering engine.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/lorant_pinter.jpg)"></div>
					<h3>Lorant Pinter - Developer at <a href="http://prezi.com/">Prezi</a></h3>
					<p>Lorant has been a software developer for more than twelve years. His most recent project at Prezi forced him out of his comfort zone of enterprise Java development, and pushed him over  to the client side. This new challenge involves many platforms, dozens of languages (including both human and computer dialects, Haxe among them), and the rekindling of his love affair with typography.</p>

					<h2>Native iOS apps with haxe objective-C target</h2>
					<p>The state of the target and what needs to be done, similarities with flash, components in the cocoa touch framework, the built-in mvc, events, and i’ll go through an app that demonstrates features of the compiler.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/cristi_baluta.jpeg)"></div>
					<h3>Cristian Băluță - Indie iOS developer</h3>
					<p>Cristi is a romanian indie iOS developer, he is 30 years old and live in Romania. He likes programming, photography and healthy eating. He has a degree in energetic engineering and began using haxe in 2007 because he was frustrated of the low speed of flash ide on mac and heard about mtasc, he was ready to use in textmate, but he shortly switched to as3 with haxe. He likes the speed and typing and continued to use it but only for flash. When flash started to give the signs of death he has started to use the js target as well. Right now he uses it for some ios/android/flash games with nme, his other work is native objective-c but he’d like to see this target alive and maybe to combine them somehow.</p>

					<h2>Making it Fly. (Haxe, Fp and Arrows)</h2>
					<p>Asynchronousity is at the heart of most modern applications, be it mobile, web, or desktop.  Functional programming techniques contain ways to tame asynchronicity in a way that is logical, useful and simple, allowing for more terse and extendable programmes with a consistent style. This talk bootstraps the various components of the idiom and introduces the necessary habits of thinking that make for an effective approach to programming.</p>

					<h3>Laurence Taylor</h3>
					<p>Alan Kay noted that a point of view is worth 80 iq points, which would be a blessed relief if I could be sure which one that was. Laurence Taylor spends his days hacking magnificent code, and his nights wondering where it all went wrong. He has been working with Haxe since the early days and is now hammering on several frameworks.</p>
