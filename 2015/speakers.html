					<h2>Haxe today and tomorrow</h2>
					<p>Of course you might already know what Haxe is. But it’s actually many different things. A language, a compiler, a set of tools. How do we define Haxe today and how will it evolve in the future? Nicolas will be there to answer these questions and present Haxe Foundation goals.</p>
					<h2>The Tech behind Evoland 2</h2>
					<p>Evoland 2 is an upcoming game by Shiro Games, involving both 2D and 3D graphics, and entirely written in Haxe. Nicolas will introduce the different technologies that were used to develop the game, and which are all available as open source, as well as the workflow the team of 9 people used to build the game.</p>

					<h2> NPM, Haxe at the heart of Javascript ecosystem</h2>
					<p>Javascript ecosystem for web app development is well implanted and NPM is at the centre of it.
Coffeescript and Typescript are perfectly integrated and have offered a real alternative to full Javascript development.
For almost a year now, Haxe has constituted a third alternative in this ecosystem.
We will look at why Haxe is a very relevant option. We will introduce its current state of integration, fonctionning and evolutions to come.</p>

					<h2>Jive: the renovation of Aswing </h2>
					<p>This talk is mainly about Jive. It’s a cross-platform UI based on AsWing, and explain to you where it comes from and go to.
The second part is about Nickolay's opinions about UI librairies : why it’s important for a community and what features it should have. Finally, he'll do a small comparaison of HaxeUI, StablexUI and Jive.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/nikolay-Gr.jpg)"></div>

					<h2>Continuous Integration for Haxe Projects</h2>
					<p>If there is anything more horrible than having bugs, it would be introducing more bugs without noticing.
In this talk, I will present how to set up continuous integration (CI) services, like TravisCI and AppVeyor,
to automatically test our Haxe code for every commit. I will also discuss some interesting use of CI that
could be useful no matter we are building games, mobile apps, websites, or writing novels.</p>

					<h2>Lime/OpenFL for home game consoles</h2>
					<p>Traditionally, developers wanting to port a PC game to consoles would hire a dedicated team to re-write the game for that platform, usually costing tens of thousands of dollars, minimum. Why can't it be as easy as exporting your existing Haxe app to mac or linux? Let's fix that.
						We'll share how we solved both the technical and the legal challenges of this undertaking, as well as our plans for making the new OpenFL console targets widely available. This talk should be of primary interest to Lime and OpenFL users who want to publish games or apps for consoles and handhelds, but will also have valuable information for users and developers of other Haxe frameworks who want to add console compatibility.

	Time and circumstances permitting, we'll also demonstrate our current progress with one or two OpenFL games that use the console technology*, Yummy Circus and Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten (HD special edition).

					<h2>Quaxe, infinity and beyond</h2>
					<p>With a very strong current focus on the Gaming industry, Haxe remains unknown outside of that inner circle. App developers outside of that industry lack important foundations to let them approach the Haxe environment, and the Haxe ecosystem remains a bit too unclear to them. Daniel willl explain my views, almost with an external eye, of the situation and how it could be fixed.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/daniel-glazman.jpg)"></div>
					<h3>Daniel Glazman aka <a href="">@glazou</a> - CEO of Disruptive Innovations and W3C CSS WG Co-chairman</h3>
					<p>Daniel is a dinosaur of Web Standards and is at the root of the  semi-official trouble-making unit at W3C, the "glazou" (a 1glazou rant being kind of a storm). Being one of the only survivors to 12 years of CSS standardization, he was appointed Co-chairman of the CSS Working Group in 2008. Newcomer to Haxe, he sees it as a potential ubiquitous programmer's dream going far beyond the Gaming industry. You can follow his <a href="http://glazman.org/weblog" target="_blank">blog</a> to learn more.</p>

					<a name="stoneham"></a>
					<h2>Prospects for using Go libraries in Haxe</h2>
					<p>Elliott’s talk will focus on his current personal passion; the development of his <a href="http://tardisgo.github.io" target="_blank">TARDIS</a> Go -> Haxe project and the potential re-use of Go libraries in Haxe. With examples ranging from Unicode normalisation to image inspection, he can promise you probably the only talk with speaking-in-tongues and nudity (not him).</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/elliott-stoneham.jpg)"></div>
					<h3>Elliott Stoneham - Freelance software developer</h3>
					<p>Elliott first discovered programming in 1974 and has been inhaling deeply ever since.

					<h2>Drakarnage: Slapping data from web servers right in your GPU</h2>
					<p>Data flow of drakarnage alongside some sample of what haxe can achieve. The data flow is interesting because ultimately we have a pretty long roundtip longing from sql, mongo, siding by redis and going back to a custom HTML renderer optimised for mobile GPU's.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/david-elahee.jpg)"></div>

					<p>A pragmatic approach to Haxe based web development, particularly on the client side. Show how Haxe can be used not only for complex long term projects, but also for quick and dirty prototypes and rapid application development.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/juraj-kirchheim.jpg)"></div>
					<h3>Juraj Kirchheim - Freelancer</h3>
					<p>Juraj has been around the Haxe community for a while now. A former flasher, now a devoted Haxer, he likes pushing the language to its limits, to annoy the compiler team to get new funky features and hang around our Google Group to help as best he can and to argue passionately in the countless discussions we have. And he still hasn’t learnt to write biographies. No macro for that just yet.</p>

					<h2>Hxcpp : State of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">union</span> enum</h2>
					<p>Asynchronousity is at the heart of most modern applications, be it mobile, web, or desktop.  Functional programming techniques contain ways to tame asynchronicity in a way that is logical, useful and simple, allowing for more terse and extendable programmes with a consistent style. This talk bootstraps the various components of the idiom and introduces the necessary habits of thinking that make for an effective approach to programming.</p>

					<h2>Cross-Platform Game Development with the GameDuell DuellTool</h2>
					<p>Sven Otto and Rui Campos will introduce GameDuell’s custom Haxe tool for the first time in public. The DuellTool provides a configurable build system, dependency resolution and a versatile developer environment setup. It was developed from scratch by the Berlin-based game developer’s team within the last year to cater the cross-platform development of casual games for the Facebook, iOS and Android platforms. The two developers will present how the tool gives platform specialists a handy workflow to seamlessly contribute to the same API’s. Further, they will share their approach for the modularity of libraries and how they defined the platform abstraction layer to provide an efficient and maintainable development process.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/sven_otto.jpg)"></div>
					<h3>Sven Otto - Lead Developer at <a href="http://www.gameduell.com" target="_blank">Game Duell</a></h3>
					<p>Sven admires programming since his youth and occasionally digested books introducing C/C++, Objective-C or 3D Games with DirectX.
Several years later he studied computer science in Berlin and released three iOS games as an indie game developer. He started working at GameDuell in 2012, where he developed an iOS game engine which is used in the French card game belote.com. Currently, he is working on a cross-platform game engine which targets iOS, Android, HTML5 and Flash, of course built with Haxe.<br/><br/></p>

					<h2>Isomorphic Haxe: Using Ufront to build apps that work client side or server side.</h2>
					<p>Most web frameworks do their work on either the client or server. But most web-apps need a combination: server side rendering is great for a fast first page load, backward compatibility and search engine optimisation. And client side rendering makes the rest of the page loads feel instant, like a native app. Jason will show how Haxe and Ufront let you get the best of both worlds.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/jason-oneil.jpg)"></div>
					<h3>Jason O'Neil - Lead Programmer at Sheridan Research Institute and founder of Today We Learned.</h3>
					<p>Jason uses Haxe to make web apps for the education market.  After going "full time" with Haxe in 2013, Jason built the Sheridan School Management System for a network of Australian schools using Haxe and Ufront.  More recently, he founded Today We Learned, an app that guides teachers in a 60 second update to send to parents - and participated in Perth's first ever seed funded start-up accelerator.  In the Haxe ecosystem Jason is known for his work on Ufront, the Haxe website and Haxelib, as well as spending far too long answering questions on Stack Overflow.  When he's not programming in Haxe he's probably asleep, dreaming of macros within macros.</p>

					<h2>TiVo Activity Haxelib</h2>
					<p>In this talk, TiVo will present the conceptual design of its activity haxelib. The activity API provides an event-driven programming paradigm with asynchronous triggers allowing multiple coordinated contexts of execution within a single program. In addition, the activity API allows increased performance on some platforms via the use of multiple threads while falling back gracefully to single threaded execution on platforms which do not; all without requiring any target specific code.

This talk will present APIs allowing the creation of and communication between activities. It will also provide examples of how the activities paradigm can enable the ability to mix multiple, previously incompatible or difficult to combine haxelibs within one program.</p>

					<h2>What's the best IDE for Haxe development?</h2>
					<p>In this lightning talk, Srikanth will share an overview of progress made in enhancing Haxe language support in IntelliJ IDEA. It will touch upon high level technical details on work done and the roadmap ahead. The talk shall include a short survey of existing IDEs (including FlashDevelop).  This session will help audience appreciate why it makes sense for the Haxe developer community to adapt IntelliJ IDEA as their first choice - be it for enterprise level development needs or as an individual programmer.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/ganapavarapu.jpg)"></div>
					<h3>Srikanth Ganapavarapu - Senior Performance Engineer at <a href="http://www.tivo.com/" target="_blank">TiVo, Inc.</a></h3>
					<p>Much of his career starting 1996, Srikanth enjoyed leading efforts and being hands-on in solving large scale scalability challenges. Currently at TiVo, Srikanth is excited to be part of the team that works hard at improving performance of the UI application that has to compete for resources with higher priority programs on a versatile embedded device.

Srikanth was introduced to Haxe in winter 2012. Since then, it’s been a wonderful ride of learning, adapting, and contributing. For him, Haxe holds the promise of many possibilities and excitement in treading uncharted waters.</p>

					<h2>Haxe in the Enterprise: A Case Study</h2>
					<p>In this talk, TiVo will present a quick update on its experiences using Haxe for user interface development on set-top box and mobile devices. We will cover the challenges experienced and lessons learned in such areas as performance measurement, API "cheating" for performance, memory leak tooling, and memory churn optimization. We will also briefly discuss the consumer reception of our Haxe-based releases and share some consumer satisfaction metrics. We hope that sharing our experiences will inspire others and facilitate collaboration on these and similar issues in the future.</p>

					<h2>You don't know FlashDevelop - tips and future</h2>
					<p>Haxe is complex, an IDE is complex, and the truth is that a majority of FlashDevelop users do not understand how they work. There is a lot of magic happening under the hood, sometimes it just works and everybody is happy, sometimes it doesn't and you need someone to blame. Or to understand how it works.FlashDevelop has changed a lot in the last 2 years, with a strong shift on Haxe, high-dpi screens and maybe someday MacOS support.</p>
					<div class="speaker-image" style="background-image:url(img/speaker/philippe-elsass.jpg)"></div>
					<h3>Philippe Elsass - Software Engineering Manager at <a href="http://massiveinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Massive Interactive</a></h3>
					<p>During the day Philippe kicks his team to write more unit tests, and at night he contemplates FlashDevelop's 0% coverage. After 10 years building throw-away marketing websites he moved to Haxe and good engineering, and he doesn't want to come back.</p>

					<h2>The MOKICK Story</h2>
					<p>In his talk, Markus will give you a sneak preview on the current development status of MOKICK. The vision behind MOKICK is to create an offline content management system and authoring tool which provides an easy and unified way for creating content of any kind - usable everywhere. He’ll show you the basic concept of the underlying graph based data model, how the editor (OpenFL) creates his views based on project specific data rule sets and content, how the PureMVC layer enables easy batch task implementation and how all this applies to a real world project.

He will further give you a brief introduction what occurrences and experiences during a long history of project developments finally led to the decision of rethinking everything, why his company now uses Haxe and what the future plans for this project are.</p>
