    <h1>hexMachina: Urban framework for hardcore developers</h1>

    <p>During the last decade, the web evolved a lot. Applications became rich, complex, smart, interactive... And, like their desktop grand sistas, they had to be more and more maintainable, scalable and flexible.</p>

	<p>This talks is about code design, and building solutions with Haxe language to provide the right answers to maintain long life-cycle applications. Sources of inspiration are many. All the concepts and ideas grew up in the street, result of 15 years of experience, exploring many other languages and technologies, and last but not least, fighting in the browser's jungle with games, websites and applications development.</p>

	<p>This presentation is targeted to every hardcore developer who wants to share some urban inspiration about code design, and have a first taste with the hexMachina framework.</p>
