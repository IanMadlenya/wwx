    <h1>Using Haxe with Unity3D and node.js</h1>

    <p>This is a talk about one of many Haxe use cases: a language for game logic shared between client and server, both of which are programmed in different languages and environments (Unity/C# and Node.JS). We'll cover how we ended up with Haxe, how it worked out, what issues did we have and how we dealt (or not) with them.</p>

      <p>Dan has been having fun with programming since he was seven, and is still enjoying it. He’s gone from web development in Python, through Flash/AS3 to game development using C# and Haxe. He seriously fell in love with Haxe and uses it to the max for his everyday work. He actively contributes to open-source tools he’s using, so Haxe became the main target of his open-source work.</p>
