					<h2>HXCPP – Haxe girt by C++</h2>
					<p>This talk covers the broad design strategy of the Haxe c++ back-end, and how this design effects the implementation. Some low-level details will also be discussed, which will imply some coding tips for optimized performance.</p>
					<img src="img/speaker/hugh-sanderson.jpg"/>
					<h3>Dr Hugh Sanderson - Lead Software Engineer at <a href="http://ddd.com">Dynamic Digital Depth</a></h3>
					<p>By day, Hugh Sanderson is the Lead Software Engineer at Dynamic Digital Depth, where he writes software for all types of stereoscopic 3D devices; by night, he develops with Haxe and is the primary author of the C++ back-end. Hugh started using Haxe in 2007 while looking for a cross platform development tool and by the end of that year he was working on the neash library for flash-like functions on the neko platform. In 2008, craving ever-higher frame rates, he started to work on the C++ back-end, which saw its first official release in mid-2009. He has continued to evolve the C++ back-end, and it now runs on almost all computing platforms that have C++ compilers. Hugh is also a principal developer of several Haxe libraries including NME, which replaced neash, to provide cross platform graphics and utilities.</p>

					<h2>First Contact: Selling Haxe to clients and developers</h2>
					<p>We all understand the power, reach and potential of Haxe as a language and a development platform. Clearly communicating these strengths to your organisation and clients is vital to the growth and success of the platform. To the ears of decision makers, Haxe sounds like risk. Just another “write once, run anywhere” pipe dream they’ve never heard of that will cost them time and money. As ambassadors to this new world we take on the responsibility of first contact – introducing, educating and convincing them on the strengths and weaknesses of Haxe. Showing them the light.</p>

					<p>Dominic has over 10 years industry experience combining user centric interaction design principles with various rich internet technologies across desktop, IPTV, inflight entertainment, mobile and embedded devices. For the last 2 years he has been responsible for developing and commercialising the cross platform Massivision UI Framework (written in Haxe of course), and selling in the virtues of Haxe to numerous high profile telcos, media organisations, broadcasters and communications companies around the world. Dominic is also a major contributor to several open source Haxe projects including MassiveUnit (unit testing) and MassiveCover (code coverage).</p>

					<h3>David Peek - UI Engineering Architect at <a href="http://massiveinteractive.com">Massive</a></h3>
					<p>Jack of all trades, master of some, David is a chronic experimenter. Weened onto programming by the gradual introduction of scripting to the Flash Player, he now works in HaXe, AS3, JavaScript, C++, Ruby and the occasional bash script. Definitely a right brain developer, he knew about easing long before he knew about encapsulation. He’s been building UI frameworks since before it was cool. David oversees the software architecture, implementation and developer workflow for the Massivision UI Framework and is responsible for a number of open source Haxe projects including RobotHaxe and HXSignals.</p>

					<h2>Britzpetermann &amp; Haxe</h2>
					<p>With childish curiosity we break impassable ways. Always having a look to the left and to the right, crossing intersections to nowhere, we run against walls and try again. On this way we don’t see the obvious, make unusual decisions and there we find our inspiration. Together with a solid craft we always fulfill our demands to discover something special in every project and bring it to the user.</p>
					<p>This, and when Haxe comes in.</p>

					<h3>Nico Zimmermann - Interactive Designer/Developer <a href="http://britzpetermann.com">britzpetermann.com</a></h3>
					<p>Coming from the ancients of computer graphics on my VC20 and Amiga, I joined the multimedia industry in 2002. After years of staight multimedia productions, now is the time to focus on drama and the beauty of things. Beyond different sizes of rectangles I explore my digital martial arts on any kind of medium.</p>

					<h2>Multiplatform productivity tool with Haxe</h2>
					<p>What would you use if you had to deliver an animation heavy, interactive application to the the Android OS, Apple iOS as well as to PCs and a dozen different browsers? Adobe has got it’s own answer. Unity3d has their own answer. But what if your code base was 100,000 lines and you wanted to include javascript? Is Haxe the right answer?</p>
					<p>This is the story of a budding romance between Prezi, a cloud based zooming presentation tool and Haxe.</p>
